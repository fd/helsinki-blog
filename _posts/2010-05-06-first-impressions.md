# First impressions

While looking for a restaurant, we just started walking down the streets with our city map we've got in the hotel. After a while we came across a nice seaman restaurant, where they served us a delicious dish, which I can't remember the name of :).

After the buikskes where filled again, we continued our walk through the city and made my first impressions complete: Helsinki is a nice city.
