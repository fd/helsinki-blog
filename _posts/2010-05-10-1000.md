# This blog was made with Jekyll

The mean machine behind this small blog was the work of Jekyll, the baby of Github user [mojombo](http://github.com/mojombo).

The reason why we chose this tool, is because it's so f***ing easy! You just write your posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), check them in in your Github repository, and Yekyll will do the rest.

More info about the hows:

Our comments where easily handled by [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).
